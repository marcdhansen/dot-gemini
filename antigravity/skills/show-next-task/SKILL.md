# Show Next Task Skill

The `show-next-task` skill provides intelligent guidance on what to work on next in the LightRAG project. It answers the question "What should we work on next?" with actionable recommendations.

## Usage

```bash
/show-next-task
```

## Purpose

This skill performs comprehensive task analysis:
1. Runs `bd ready` to display all available tasks
2. Analyzes the task priority landscape (P0, P1, P2)
3. Indicates which tasks are currently in progress
3. Provides intelligent recommendations based on project impact
4. Offers concrete next steps to get started immediately

## Implementation

The skill executes:

```bash
./.agent/skills/show-next-task/scripts/next.sh
```

## Workflow Analysis

The script performs intelligent analysis:

1. **Task Discovery**: Captures full `bd ready` output
2. **Priority Classification**: Categorizes tasks by priority level
3. **Impact Assessment**: Provides recommendations based on:
   - **P0 Tasks**: Critical blockers requiring immediate attention
   - **P1 Tasks**: High-impact work with clear deliverables
   - **P2 Tasks**: Strategic work advancing project goals
   - **In Progress Tasks**: Work currently underway
4. **Action Planning**: Suggests specific commands to get started

## Response Format

The skill delivers:

1. **Complete Task List**: Full `bd ready` output for context
2. **Priority Analysis**: Task count breakdown (P0: X, P1: Y, P2: Z)
3. **Intelligent Recommendations**: Priority-based guidance with reasoning
4. **Concrete Next Steps**: Specific `bd` commands and git workflow steps
5. **Project Context Links**: Roadmap, docs, and session status resources

## Decision Logic

**P0 Available**: Immediate attention required
- Recommendation: Start with P0 tasks first
- Reasoning: These are blocking project progress

**P1 Only**: High-priority work
- Recommendation: Tackle P1 tasks for maximum impact
- Reasoning: High importance with clear deliverables

**P2 Only**: Strategic development
- Recommendation: Work on P2 tasks systematically
- Reasoning: Advance project goals methodically

## Integration

This skill integrates with:
- **Beads Task Management**: `bd ready` command for task discovery
- **LightRAG Protocols**: Project priorities and workflow standards
- **Agent Coordination**: Session status and multi-agent workflows
- **Git Operations**: Branch creation and task assignment workflows

## Example Output

```
🎯 What should we work on next in the LightRAG project?
=========================================================
📋 Current Available Tasks: [full bd ready output]
🤔 Agent's Analysis & Recommendations:
📊 Task Priority Breakdown: P0: 1, P1: 2, P2: 7
🚨 IMMEDIATE ATTENTION (P0 Tasks):
⚡ lightrag-ggt: Make SOP evaluation mandatory in RTB process
💡 Recommendation: Start with the P0 task(s) - they are blocking project progress.
🚀 Next Steps: • Start top task: `bd start lightrag-ggt`
```

## Error Handling

The skill gracefully handles:
- Beads daemon not running
- No ready tasks available
- Command execution failures
- Network connectivity issues
